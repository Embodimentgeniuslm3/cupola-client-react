## Description

The objective of this project is to connect home buyers to sellers and tenants to renters directly to <u>facilitate services including home trading and residential leasing without the intervention of local real estate agency</u> as mostly they add no value to the transactions but substantially cost for both parties. 

This web application is a third-party real estate broker platform providing real-time real estate listings and services to promote transparent home trading and leasing transactions for home buyers, sellers, renters, and tenants.
